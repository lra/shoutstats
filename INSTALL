Installation of Shoutstats is pretty simple:

- Make sure rrdtools and PHP are correctly installed and running.

- Do some "tar zxvf shoutstats-*.tar.gz" in the directory you want shoutstats to be avalaible on the www (let's suppose it's /var/www)

- cd to your shoutstats directory, eg. /var/www/shoutstats

- Edit the "config.ini" file and edit the parameters as you like.

- Edit the "servers.ini" file and add your shoutcasts and icecasts servers in it.

- Make sure the "gfx" and "rrd" folders in your shoutstats directory are chmod 777. If not, do "chmod 777 gfx rrd"

- You can now put the following line in your crontab:
  */5 * * * * root /usr/bin/wget -q -O /tmp/update.php --delete-after http://your.host.com/shoutstats/update.php
  You can change the frequency. The more frequent, the more precise your stats will be.
